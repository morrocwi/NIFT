# **1. Philosophical Foundation**

Before NIFT is a physics framework,
**it is an ontology: a statement about what reality fundamentally is.**

### **Information is reality.**

The universe does not *contain* information —
the universe *is* information arranged in dynamic patterns.

### **Reality is asymmetric.**

Symmetry creates no structure and no direction of flow.
Asymmetry drives evolution, selection, memory, and stability.

### **Asymmetry stabilizes through balanced force ratios.**

The universe preserves itself by distributing informational imbalance
across dimensional channels (surface, mixed, volume) in fixed proportions.

### **Pixel-soliton is the root architecture of matter.**

Every “particle” is a localized, self-consistent knot of informational density
supported by pixel geometry (2π holonomy, 4π field reach, 1 nat capacity).

### **Mass is locked information. Energy is information in motion.**

There are no separate categories — only different regimes of the same field.

> **Physics is informational imbalance seeking equilibrium under constraints.**

This worldview, drawn from NEIP/Planck Mosaic/Axioms, is the anchor of NIFT.
Everything else — equations, couplings, spectra, cosmology — emerges from it.

# **2. How the Universe Works (Conceptual Summary)**

From the philosophical foundation, NIFT builds a minimal operational picture:

### **2.1 The Universe as an Informational Continuum**

Reality is modeled by:

* informational density *m(x,t)*
* informational current *j(x,t)*
* informational potential *Φ_I*
* causal memory time *τ_c*

At the Planck scale, the world is a mosaic of **informational pixels**, each with:

* **1 nat** capacity
* **2π** topological closure
* **4π** geometric propagation kernel
* holographic constraint **A / 4ℓ_P²**

### **2.2 Local Dynamics: Causal Flow**

Information propagates through a telegraph-type law:

```
∂t m + ∇·j = S_in – Γ_dis  
τc ∂t j + j = –D ∇m  
```

No instantaneous signaling. No non-local collapse.
The causal limit is guaranteed by **v ≤ c**.

### **2.3 Global Geometry: Curvature from Information**

Patterns of *m* create potentials:

```
∇² Φ_I = κ_I m
Φ_N = c² Φ_I
```

Gravity becomes **informational curvature**
consistent with Newton’s law and weak-field GR.

### **2.4 Emergence: Mass as Integrated Information**

```
M = (c² / 4πG) ∫ m(x) dV
```

Stable information → mass
Reconfiguring information → energy
Information capacity → horizons

### **2.5 Pixel-Soliton Spectrum: Root of Particles & Forces**

A pixel-soliton arises from the equilibrium of:

* holonomy (2π)
* radial geometry (4π)
* holographic bound
* telegraph stabilization

Fermions, gauge bosons, and composite excitations
are manifestations of this informational architecture.

# **3. Key Results (2025)**

### **3.1 Fermion Information Theorem**

Every fermion with a physical rest frame contains:

```
I_f = 2π nat
```

### **3.2 Universal Gauge Efficiency**

From Crofton–Cauchy geometry × pixel functional constraints:

```
η = 3 / (5π)
```

### **3.3 Dimensional Origins of the Forces**

* EM: d = 2
* Weak: d = 2.769
* Strong: d = 4

### **3.4 Lepton Spectrum from C₅ Pixel Ring**

1 : 16 : 400 mass ratios
Koide value Q = 417/625 = 0.6672

No tuning. Pure informational geometry.
