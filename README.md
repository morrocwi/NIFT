# Non-Equilibrium Informational Field Theory (NIFT)

A unified framework in which quantum information is a dynamical field governed by entropic forces and discrete geometric constraints.

**Core results (2025):**
- Every Compton-localized fermion carries **exactly 2π nat** of information (Theorem).
- Gauge-charge accounting fixed to **η = 3/(5π)** by pixel geometry (Theorem).
- Charged-lepton mass ratios **1 : 16 : 400** derived from PDE spectrum on a 5-site ring with 2 forbidden slots.
- Koide relation reproduced as **Q = 417/625 = 0.6672** — within PDG 2024 error bars — **with no free parameters**.

This is physics.
